The website must have the following features:<br>
● Show the existing clients ✅<br>
● Add and remove a client✅<br>
● Filter the clients (e.g. all the clients with the surname “Cohen”) ✅<br>
● Input fields should be validated (at least at minimum level) - both on frontend and backend✅

Backend Extras:<br>
● Usage of a database - A must. You can use SQL, NoSQL, anything you feel comfortable with✅<br>
● When adding a new client, use some IP information API and store the geo data from it (city,
country) so we can later query by it (Bonus points here!). You can use any API you find online.✅
For example - https://ip-api.com/<br>
● ID field should be validated according to Israeli ID validation guidelines ✅<br>
